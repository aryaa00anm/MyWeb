  <h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
  <P>Hey there! I'm Aryasatya Bauddha, and I'm thrilled to have you on my little corner of the web. <br>
    A bit about me? Well, grab a cup of tea and let me share my story with you.</P>

  <hr width="100%" size="15px" color="#2C3E50">

  <H2>BACKGROUND:</H2>
  <p>I come from a rich tapestry of experiences and a lineage deeply rooted in service and talent. <br>
    My father proudly serves in the Indian Army, and his father, my grandfather, contributed to the transportation
    department of the army, <br>
    adding to the family's legacy of dedication to our nation. <br> <br> <br>

    On the maternal side, my grandfather, a skilled professional in education, was more than just a teacher <br>
    he's a polymath. From teaching to cooking, carpentry, and beyond, <br>
    his versatility is a testament to the wealth of skills he possesses. <br>
    my mom is the headmaster of a government school. Growing up, I've had the privilege of exploring different places
    <br>
    as my dad got posted to various locations. <br> <br> <br>

    Our roots trace back to the quaint villages of Ailau and Beelon, <br>
    where stories of resilience and community echo through the generations. <br>
    It's from these humble beginnings that I draw inspiration and a profound appreciation <br>
    for the diversity that shapes <b>WHO I AM TODAY.</b>
  </p>

  <H2>PASSION AND INTERESTS:</H2>
  <p>From a young age, I've been a sports enthusiast, dabbling in football, cricket, badminton, swimming, skating,
    archery, shooting, and more! <br>
    But beyond the playing field, my heart has always been drawn to engineering. <br>
    I used to tinker with simple devices, even without fully grasping the technical details.</p>

  <hr width="100%" size="15px" color="#2C3E50">

  <H2>ACADEMIC ASPIRATIONS:</H2>
  <p>Currently aiming for IIT, my love for Physics and a fascination with space drive my academic pursuits. <br>
    The dream of unraveling the mysteries of the universe has me hooked. <br>
    Although becoming a NASA astronaut was a childhood dream, practicalities led me to set my sights on the Indian Air
    Force and Navy, <br>
    with a goal to become a fighter pilot.</p>

  <hr width="100%" size="15px" color="#2C3E50">

  <H2>PERSONAL CONNECTIONS:</H2>
  <p>Dark humor? Guilty as charged! I find humor in the unexpected and appreciate the lighter side of life. <br>
    Being an introvert, expressing myself through this website is my way of letting you peek into my world.</p>
